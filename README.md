# flowstate README

Hello, fellow connoisseur of the Flow State. 

Click the Coffee Icon in the Status Bar after installing the Extension to start.

This extension helps you to get into / and stay in the flow state while coding. Start your session by setting a goal üèÖ and a timer ‚è±Ô∏è for it. The extension will set you to Do Not Disturb üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è on Slack for the set time (further integrations coming).

What helps you get into the flow or stay in it? Mention it in the comment section.
